# Q-Hub

The Chat App is a technology designed for all different types of users looking to have a discussion with other users on the platform. This app can be used for many things, including finding solutions to different problems in the work or school life, discussing problems in everday life, or just for social interaction. The user creates a profile and automatically becomes able to start posting their own messages on the board or start replying to other user's posts. It has the functionality of a message board, where everything is on the front page and you're able to access different posts and comment very efficiently.
